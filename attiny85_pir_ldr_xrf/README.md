attiny85 wireless sensor node
-------------

This repository contains the code for an attiny85 driven wireless sensor node.
For the wireless functions, a Ciseco XRF is utilised.

Features:

- Low power consumption (battery powered)
- DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
- LDR for luminosity readings
- PIR for motion detection / alarm

This is currently a prototype as PCBs have not yet been designed, however the code works on a stripboard development version.

The Arduino IDE is used for programming, with the following core: https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tiny/
